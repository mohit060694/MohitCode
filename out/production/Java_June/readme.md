LECTURE-1
* Syntax - How you write a language example - Declaration a variable or initialisation
* datatype_name of variable; - declaration (int x;)
  datatype_name of variable = value ; - initialisation and declaration (int x = 5 ;)
  x is variable and 5 above also known as literal
* datatype - primitive (that can change or overwrite) or non-primitive
Java is strong typed language

LECTURE-2
* Primitive Data Type- 
 pre-defined datatype, have specific size, can be changed or over-write
 byte, short, int, long, double, float, char,  boolean
 127- int short long 
 true/false-boolean
 decimal-float or double
* Operators-
 Addition(+),Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/), Modulus(%)
 increment (++), decrement(--)
* Concept of increment & decrement-
  post increment(x++ or x--) and pre increment (++x or --x)
  when we do post increment, it is executed on the same line but appears only
  on the next line whereas in case of pre increment, it is executed &n appears
  on the same line.
* Assignment operator-
  x=10;(Right to left) here x is not equal to 10, it means 10 is assigned to x.
* Operators- Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment, bitwise
  * Arithmetic- +,-,*,/,%,++,--
  * Comparison- ==, !=, <, >, >=, <= (Gives boolean result)
  * Assignment- =, +=, -= (x+=10 it means x=x+10)
  * Logical- && (logical AND- both must true), logical OR operator (any one condition true),! (not equal to)
